# Project IV
## Convolutional Neural Network

- The task is to create a convolutional network that allows to recognise clothes on the basis of the MNIST Fashion set.
- Please visualise several convolutional filters (what the network "sees") - this involves passing a sample through the network (forward pass), taking the activation value of the selected layer and filter, and then displaying it via imshow.
- Additionally, please apply the Softmax layer and for several examples display a bar chart (barplot) with probabilities, predicted value and true value - please also include the checked image on the chart (with matplotlib).
- The project should include training and testing of the network.
